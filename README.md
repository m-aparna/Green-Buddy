## Files used:

weather.py- 

This file contains the code necessary for processing and fetching weather data.It handles the interaction with weather APIs to retrieve and process weather-related information.

planting_advice.pyâ€”

This file includes the logic for checking weather conditions and generating alerts based on those conditions.
It also provides system-generated planting advice
to help users make informed decisions about their gardening activities.

shops.py-

This file manages the code for fetching information about nearby gardening shops.It processes data from APIs
to provide users with details about local gardening stores,
including their locations and other relevant information.

## Testing

- pytest- Used pytest as the testing framework for testing weather and places API functions.Pytest provides powerful features such as fixtures, parameterized testing, and plugins. Fixtures allow for setting up pre-test conditions and tearing them down after tests are executed, which can reduce code repetition and improve maintainability.
Parameterized testing allows running the same test function with different sets of inputs, which is useful for checking a wide range of scenarios efficiently.

       pip install pytest
