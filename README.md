# üå± Green-Buddy- Your Home Gardening Buddy üë®‚Äçüåæ‚úÇÔ∏èüå≥üçÄ
Group project -Group-1

## üì¢ About The Project:
Green Buddy is a user-friendly website designed to help both registered and guest users perform gardening activities efficiently and effectively. With this app, users can create their own account to access information like detailed plant information,plant care tips,weather forecast details,nearby gardening shops,recommended videos based on plant to help plan their gardening activities effectively.

Green Buddy was created with an aim
to address the challenges
that many gardeners face
for not having proper information, such as choosing the right plants,understanding the care requirements, and managing their gardens effectively.
The website provides personalized recommendations, brief suggestions based on temperature, care guides,
and a platform where users can share their gardening experiences and advice.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement:

While gardening is an interesting hobby, but sometimes it is frustrating if things are not planned due to not having proper information.Some of the challenges faced by new gardeners are:

1. Lack of proper plant information: Many Gardeners don't have proper information about the plants.Lack of proper information about the plant results in poor planting.

2. Inadequate Plant Care: Due to lack of information and knowledge about plant care, gardeners especially new gardeners often struggle to take proper care for different types of plants. Care for plants often requires proper knowledge on areas like pruning,watering,sunlight requirements.This results in unhealthy plants and a bad gardening experience.

3. Adaptation to weather: Gardeners often struggle to get adapted to the rapidly changing weather conditions. Without proper information of weather conditions gardeners face poor planting experience which also damages their plants and affect the schedules of gardeners.

4. Limited Access to Quality Garden Shops: For gardeners it is important to get good quality of gardening supplies and advice on plants at local shops.Due to lack of time  and finding a good quality shop with proper rating,address where they can buy plants and other related items is challenging for gardeners.Not all garden shops offer a  range of products or knowledgeable staff, making it difficult for gardeners to find what they need.

5. User preference for visual information: Sometimes gardeners don't like to only read data. User prefers to visualise information through videos. Lack of proper information on good videos to follow may result in following bad suggestions.
