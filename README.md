Group project -Group-1

## üì¢ About The Project:
Green Buddy is a user-friendly website designed to  With this app, users can create their own account to access information like detailed plant information, plant care tips,weather forecast details, nearby gardening shops,recommended videos based on plant to help plan their gardening activities effectively.

Green Buddy was created with an aim
to address the challenges
that many gardeners face
for not having proper information, such as choosing the right plants,understanding the care requirements, and managing their gardens effectively.
The website provides personalized recommendations, brief suggestions based on temperature, care guides,
and an interactive platform where users can add a specific plant to their profile, including species information and other relevant detail to keep track of their plant.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement:

While gardening is an interesting hobby, it can become frustrating if not planned properly due to a lack of information. Some challenges faced by new gardeners include:

1. Lack of Proper Plant Information: Many gardeners do not have the necessary information about plants, leading to poor planting decisions and unsuccessful gardens.

2. Inadequate Plant Care: Due to lack of information and knowledge about plant care, gardeners especially new gardeners often struggle to take proper care for different types of plants. Care for plants often requires proper knowledge on areas like pruning,watering,sunlight requirements.This results in unhealthy plants and a bad gardening experience.

3. Adaptation to weather: Gardeners often find it difficult to adapt to changing weather conditions. Without accurate weather information, they may struggle to plan their planting schedules, leading to damaged plants and a poor gardening experience.

4. Limited Access to Quality Garden Shops: For gardeners, it is important to get good quality of gardening supplies and advice on plants at local shops.Due to lack of time  and finding a good quality shop with proper rating,address where they can buy plants and other related items is challenging for gardeners.Not all garden shops offer a  range of products or knowledgeable staff, making it difficult for gardeners to find what they need.

5. User preference for visual information: Many gardeners prefer to learn through videos rather than just reading text. A lack of reliable video resources can lead to following incorrect advice, impacting their gardening success.

## üí° Solutions:

The goal of Green Buddy is to create a single platform that offers multiple services at one place, making it easier for gardeners, especially those who are new to gardening.The solutions provided by Green Buddy include:

## üéØ API Endpoints to make HTTP requests:

- [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

   This is an open source API that offers real time weather data services for a current location.This endpoint has been used to fetch 5 day average weather forecast along with current day's weather details.

       https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast??q={city name}&appid={API key}&units=metric 
    
   To fetch weather data, replace {city name} with the desired city and {API key} with your own API key. This endpoint returns weather data in metric units..


- [Plant API](https://perenual.com/docs/api)

   This open source API provides information about plants and their care guides.

   - For plant information the base url is: 
         https://perenual.com/api/species/details/{id}?key={api_key}
  
   - For plant care guide the base url is: 
         https://perenual.com/api/species-care-guide-list?species_id={id}&key={api_key}
    
   - Note: We need to enter the id - ex: 50 in place of {id} and api key in place of {api_key}

    

- [Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

   The YouTube API provides wide-range of access realted to YouTube videos. Videos can be filtered based on several factors like channel, rating, etc.

## üöÄModules/Packages/library:

- **Requests:** This module allows sending HTTP requests from python

            pip install requests



- **Collections:** t is a built-in module (No installation is required). The collection Module in Python provides different types of containers. A Container is an object that is used to store different objects and provide a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them. 


  In this project we have used Counter().


   **Counter() -** A counter is a subclass of the dictionary. It is used to keep the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered dictionary where the key represents the element in the iterable and value represents the count of that element in the iterable.
    
            from collections import Counter

            

- **flask:** A WSGI web application framework for Python.  It is used to build websites using python. We chose this because of its efficient and beginner-friendly ability to create good-looking websites, easy integration with Databases and smooth handling of requests from users.


            pip install flask



   **NOTE** - Installing flask automatically installs some other dependencies we have used in the project (jinja2 and werkzeug)


No need to install it. It needs to be imported from flask.


- **Flask login:** Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask.It handles the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering users' sessions over extended periods of time.
      
          pip install flask-login

- **Flask SQLAlchemy:** Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for integrating SQLAlchemy with Flask. It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to achieve common tasks.

      pip install flask-sqlalchemy


- **Google API client (YouTube API):** Library to easily manage API calls and other processes for Google APIs
